Project Proposal

New York City has been very loud for decades due to the mass amount of people, its crime rates have also been also increasing throughout the years.
In some regions of NYC crime rates can be much higher than others which can correspond with that region having 
more noise complaints in Residential, Street/Sidewalks, Commercial buildings, and Parks all around NYC. 

The crime dataset can link the number of noise complaints per city/borough with the number of crimes per city/borough. 
The goal is to explore whether areas with higher crime rates experience more noise complaints or not. 
Areas where there’s a lot of sex crimes/harassment may contribute to the noise complaints that occur in those areas.
Another possibility is that areas where there’s theft occurring in a Resident - Apt. 
House may result in a filing for noise complaint as Residential noise type for our primary dataset.
